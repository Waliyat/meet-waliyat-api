# PM as a Service (PMaaS)

## 🚀 Overview
What if your next Product Manager came with API documentation? This is my attempt to answer that question.

I'm Waliyat, and this is my portfolio presented as a REST API - because sometimes the best way to show you understand developer experience is to become the API.

## 📖 Documentation
**[View Live API Docs →](https://waliyat.github.io/meet-waliyat-api/)**

## 🔧 Available Endpoints

### Core Services
- `GET /experience` - Returns 5+ years of enterprise product management

- `POST /challenges` - Submit any API or enterprise integration problem
